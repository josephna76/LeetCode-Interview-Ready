# Study-LeetCode

## Description

This repository is dedicated to my journey through solving problems on LeetCode. It's not just a collection of solutions, but a testament to an organized workflow and a practice arena for setting up classes, creating custom test cases, handling edge cases, and executing code via the command line.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

- **Tracking Progress**: Documenting my progress on LeetCode problems.
- **Demonstrating Organized Workflow**: Showcasing a professional and systematic approach to problem-solving.
- **Practice and Learning**: Improving my skills in setting up classes, writing comprehensive test cases, and understanding edge cases.
- **Command Line Proficiency**: Running and testing code using command line interfaces.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the source code files, organized by problem categories.
- `tests/`: Includes test cases for each problem, emphasizing on covering edge cases.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts and common modules used across different solutions.
- `docs/`: Any documentation or notes related to the problems or concepts.

## How to Use

To run a solution:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/study-leetcode.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd study-leetcode/src
   ```

3. Run the desired solution file:

   ```bash
   python [solution-file].py
   ```

To run tests:

1. Navigate to the `tests/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd study-leetcode/tests
   ```

2. Run the test file for a specific problem:

   ```bash
   python test_[problem-name].py
   ```

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal log of my LeetCode journey, suggestions or advice on improving solutions, test cases, or any other aspect of the repository are always welcome.
